This programme will calculate the interest on an investment or loan repayment.

Intro message to present choice of calculator (investment or bond).
Request input choice of calulator.
Set input to accept variety of capitalised options as answers. 
Do this by setting answer to record in lower case. 
If input is incorrect then give error message and re-request an option from the menu. 
if investment chosen - to collect information needed for calculation 
(deposit, interest and no. of years)
request choice of simple or compound interest
loop back to question if alternative answer is entered. 
calculate using respective formulae and printing result in a sentence format.

if bond chosen request information required for calculation
calculate repayment amount and output this in a sentence. 
following main code apply formatting and rounding of figures.
