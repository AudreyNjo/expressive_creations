This repository is meant to present programmes that I have built from scratch using python . Some of these are tasks given in a software engineering bootcamp that I am
currently attending and some are just me praciticing what i have learnt or just built for fun. 
I have a passion for learning and as I add to my knowledge I will be adding to this repository. So keep checking back!
